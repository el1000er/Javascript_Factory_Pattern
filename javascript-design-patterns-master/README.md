# Design Patterns In Javascript

Design Patterns can help us write more efficient, maintainable and clearer code. They're time tested solutions to common problems in software design. I've recently taken a closer interest in design patterns and decided to document the types of design patterns I've come across, as they apply specifically to Javascript. A lot of the examples out there are pre-ES2015 and I thought it would be nice to redo them in more mordern syntax.

Please note that not all examples have been converted fully to ES6. It is a work in progress and I'll be refactoring the code as I progress.

Each folder contains a small app which illustrates a design pattern. The folders are named after the design patterns they illustrate. The samples are simplistic and intended only to illustrate the features of each pattern.

## Walkthrough

You can find articles walking through each design pattern on my Medium. Currently the first article on the **Factory Pattern** is up. As I add more articles, I'll list the links below:

### Creational Design Patterns

- Factory Pattern - [Link](https://medium.com/@thebabscraig/javascript-design-patterns-part-1-the-factory-pattern-5f135e881192)

### Behavioural Design Patterns

- Publisher/Subscriber Pattern - [Link](https://medium.com/@thebabscraig/javascript-design-patterns-part-2-the-publisher-subscriber-pattern-8fe07e157213)
- Strategy Pattern - TBD
- Observer Pattern - TBD
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern - TBD
- Mediator Pattern - TBD
- Iterator Pattern - TBD

### Structural Design Patterns

- Facade Pattern - TBD
- Decorator Pattern - TBD
- Adapter Pattern - TBD
- Composite Pattern - TBD
- Proxy Pattern - TBD

## To run the files:

1.  `git clone` the repo to a local folder.
2.  Run `npm install` to install the node_modules (this is mainly for nodemon so we can run node with autorefresh enabled)
3.  There are two commands, `npm start` and `npm run start-dev`.
4.  To run the examples, pass in the folder name for the specific design pattern as an npm argument. For example, to run the "**factory**" design pattern, you would enter the command` in your temrinal.
5.  The folder names correspond to the design pattern names.

This is still a work in progress and I'll be adding more design patterns
